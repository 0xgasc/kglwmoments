# FlyInGuate Experiences - Status Update

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

I've successfully added all the missing experiences from the FlyInGuate website to your application:

### 1. **Enhanced Demo Data** (Currently Active)
The experiences page now includes 8 comprehensive helicopter experiences with full details:

- **Heli-Tour Ciudad, Antigua & Laguna Calderas** ($479) - 35 min scenic tour
- **Panoramic Overflight - 45 min** ($745) - Extended scenic tour
- **Romantic Heli-Tour** ($525) - Special romantic experience
- **Four Volcanoes Tour** ($1,899) - Epic volcano circuit
- **Tikal National Park Expedition** ($4,500) - Full day Mayan ruins tour
- **Lake Atitl√°n Complete Experience** ($2,299) - Lake tour with boat and villages
- **Monterrico Beach Experience** ($1,599) - Beach and turtle sanctuary
- **Seven Volcanoes + Atitl√°n Tour** ($3,299) - Ultimate volcano experience

### 2. **Features Added**
- ‚úÖ Bilingual support (English/Spanish) for all experiences
- ‚úÖ Category filtering (Scenic, Romantic, Volcano, Cultural, Beach)
- ‚úÖ Multiple aircraft options with different capacities
- ‚úÖ Detailed inclusions for each experience
- ‚úÖ Route waypoints and duration information
- ‚úÖ Loading states and error handling

### 3. **Technical Implementation**
- Modified `/src/app/book/experiences/page.tsx` to include comprehensive demo data
- Added fallback mechanism when database is not available
- Fixed the infinite re-render issue in the transport booking page
- Improved error handling and user experience

## üîÑ Current Status

The experiences page is currently showing a **loading state** because it's trying to fetch from the database. Since the database doesn't have the multilingual schema yet, it falls back to the demo data automatically.

## üìù To See The Experiences

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/book/experiences
2. The page will show a loading spinner briefly
3. Then it will display all 8 experiences with filtering options

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add these experiences to your Supabase database:

1. **Update Database Schema** - Add the multilingual columns to the experiences table
2. **Run Migration** - Apply the `experiences-multilingual.sql` file in Supabase SQL editor
3. **Admin Panel** - Create an admin interface to manage experiences

For now, the demo data provides a fully functional experience catalog that matches the real FlyInGuate website offerings!
